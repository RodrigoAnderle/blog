Have some time that I am planing to come back to write something in this blog, but life was very complicate in the last months. 
In fact, have some time that life become complicate to me. Since I finished my PhD and started as a postdoctoral researcher I fell that I need more skills related 
to my personal organization. Basicaly, because I strugle a lot to manage my variety of interests and goals. Also, I was worry about what was expected to me as a 
postdocotral resarcher. As a fresh PhD, I imagined that I shoud know several things that actually I didn't know. Most of them I still don't know very well.
Of course, this was a huge source of anxiety that instigate me to want to know more things in a short time space.
